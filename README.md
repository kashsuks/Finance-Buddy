## About me

I built this project as an assignment for grade 9 mathematics as a part of the computing chapter. It was related to financial literacy and we had the choice to built any app, mobile application, deskptop application, etc. I chose to build a client-sided web app since Front-End development was something that I was unfamiliar with at the time. I'm proud to say that it's one of my strengths when it comes to programming. I hope you find this useful, and let me know if there are any changes to be made since this is an ongoing project that I would love to contribute to.
